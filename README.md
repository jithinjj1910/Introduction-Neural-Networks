# Introduction-Neural-Networks
In this assignment, you will build a complete neural network using Numpy. You will implement all the steps required to build a network - feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates etc.

You will use the MNIST dataset to train your model to classify handwritten digits between 0-9.

The assignment is divided into the following sections:
1. Data preparation
2. Feedforward
3. Loss computation
4. Backpropagation
5. Parameter updates
6. Model training and predictions
